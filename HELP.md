## Running the tests

To run the included *tests*, run the test file using the `pytest` module:

```bash
$ python3 -m pytest main_test.py
```

Many IDE's and code editors have built-in support for using Pytest to run tests; check them out [here](https://github.com/exercism/python/blob/main/docs/TOOLS.md#editors-and-ides).

For more information about running tests using `pytest`, checkout our [Python testing guide](https://github.com/exercism/python/blob/main/docs/TESTS.md#pytest).
